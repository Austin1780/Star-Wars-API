# Star Wars API

This single page React application pulls data from a public [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) and then displays that data in a custom UI. The home page displays a custom Star Wars crawl within an iframe:

Selecting one of the menu buttons will direct you to a subject page, such as films or people:

Selecting the pagination buttons at the bottom will continue to the next page of data from the API:
