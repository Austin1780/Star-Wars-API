# Star Wars API

This single page React application pulls data from a public [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) and then displays that data in a custom UI. The home page displays a custom Star Wars crawl within an iframe:

Selecting one of the menu buttons will direct you to a subject page, such as films or people:

Selecting the pagination buttons at the bottom will continue to the next page of data from the API:

## Installation:

To run the program on your local machine, clone the repo, run npm install on the command line, and then npm start. The home page will display and prompt you to click on BB8, which will trigger the iframe to play a custom Star Wars crawl introduction about single page applications.
